My project is going to be an AI application that detects that face of the car driver so we can decide if the driver
is sleeping or not. In case he was sleeping an alert must be turned on to wake him up, by that we are reducing the risks
of accedants and death rate. This application especially specifies the trucks drivers and heavy machines because they work 
at night more than normal people, taxi drivers or anyone who depends on his income on driving machines or vehicles.
